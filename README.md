# Next-Level-Fitness

![Logo](images/Next-Level.svg)

The first capstone project at Microverse.  We had to recreate the home page and about page based on [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) design but using a different business as the topic.  In my project I based it on a gym.  The webpage has a home page and about page which are designed using a mobile first approach  but can scale up to a desktop with a different design.  On the mobile site there is a modal memu which opens using javascript when the hamburger button is clicked.

The fitness classes offered by the gym are populated dynamically from an array of javascript objects
